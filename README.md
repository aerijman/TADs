The [sequences](https://github.com/aerijman/Transcriptional-Activation-Domains) will be uploaded to [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) and are analysed with Lukasz's codes.

## How to use the codes
1. Lukasz will explain this in detail! :+1:
2. For now I added the MIT lisence, though you should decide which licence to use.
